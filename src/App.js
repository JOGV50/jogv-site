                <>
                  <p>My name is Rusty Reynolds, and I grew up in the foster care system. I didn‚Äôt have a mom to call when life got hard, or a dad to teach me how to face the world. What I had were caseworkers, strangers‚Äô houses, and the quiet, heavy truth that the people who were supposed to love me the most couldn‚Äôt keep me.</p>
                  <p>By the time most kids were learning who they were, I was learning how to survive. I learned how to read people, how to adapt quickly, and how to build walls just strong enough to keep my heart safe. But I also learned something else‚Äîthat even in the hardest places, you can choose who you become.</p>
                  <p>I‚Äôve been the kid sitting silently at someone else‚Äôs dinner table, afraid to take up too much space. I‚Äôve been the teenager aging out of the system, wondering if I‚Äôd ever belong anywhere. And I‚Äôve been the young adult stumbling into the real world with no family safety net, making mistake after mistake while trying to figure out how to build a life from scratch.</p>
                  <p><strong>But here‚Äôs what I want you to know:</strong> I made it. Not because someone saved me, but because I decided I wasn‚Äôt going to let my past define me. I worked my way up from the bottom. I built a career. I became a father. I learned to love myself in a way no one had taught me as a child.</p>
                  <p>This book isn‚Äôt written by a social worker or a psychologist. It‚Äôs written by someone who lived it‚Äîsomeone who knows what it feels like to be invisible, unwanted, and lost. Someone who also knows the quiet power that grows inside you when you refuse to give up.</p>
                  <p>I‚Äôm not here to tell you it‚Äôs easy. I‚Äôm here to tell you it‚Äôs possible.</p>
                </>
              ) : (
                <>
                  <p>Too many of us have been sold the lie that our job is our identity‚Äîthat what we do to pay bills is the same as why we‚Äôre here. But that‚Äôs not the truth. A job can keep food on the table, but it alone will never fulfill your true ambitions. I wrote this book because I‚Äôve walked both sides of the road: the long hours, the steady paychecks, the false sense of security‚Äîand the crash that comes when you realize a job can disappear in an instant. I‚Äôve also walked the other side‚Äîthe freedom and fulfillment that comes from discovering your real purpose, and building a life around it.</p>
                  <p>This book is not about quitting your job tomorrow. It‚Äôs about waking up to the bigger truth: your job is not your purpose. Your purpose is bigger, deeper, and more powerful than any position, paycheck, or promotion.</p>
                  <p>For years, I thought my identity was tied to the roles I held and the hours I put in. I know what it‚Äôs like to chase recognition, to believe that loyalty to a company meant security for my family. But security proved fragile. The economy shifts. Leadership changes. Promises break. And when they do, you‚Äôre left asking: Who am I without the job? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this book‚Äîto remind you that you are so much more than the hours you clock.</p>
                  <p>My promise is simple: if you‚Äôll lean into the lessons here, you‚Äôll start to see your life in a different light. You‚Äôll see that setbacks can be fuel, that comfort can be a trap, and that passion can become a pathway. You‚Äôll see that your life is not about clocking in‚Äîit‚Äôs about refusing the time trap and finding the bravery, courage, desire, and passion to step fully into your life. That‚Äôs what truly ensures you level up.</p>
